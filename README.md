# My First Commit Story
Once upon a time there was a new developer. They wanted to learn how to use github. So they wrote a story about how to make changes to code. And then share with github.

#My Second Commit Story
This time around, I am reviewing so I will commit again.

# Project Summary

In this project, you will re-create three different layouts using HTML and CSS. Each layout is broken into a different folder. Inside each layout's folder you'll find an `index.html`, `index.css`, and an image file. The goal is to get as close as possible to the given design. Use the given image as a reference.

Since there are so many ways you can create the layout with HTML and CSS, there will not be a guide. However, if you get stuck, there will be an included solution to help you.

As stated before, your code doesn't need to match the solution exactly, but it should match the provided image as closely as possible.
